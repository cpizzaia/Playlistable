## Summary

Playlistable takes your favorite music and artists and finds similar music
to your taste in the the form of a completely new algorithically generated 100 track playlist.

Architected using the ReSwift library, Playlistable is a fully functionally programmed
iOS application built for failure tolerance and unidirectional dataflow, allowing it
to easily scale to new features and control complex state under highly asychronous conditions.
